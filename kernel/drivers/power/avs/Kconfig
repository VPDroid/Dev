menuconfig POWER_AVS
	bool "Adaptive Voltage Scaling class support"
	help
	  AVS is a power management technique which finely controls the
	  operating voltage of a device in order to optimize (i.e. reduce)
	  its power consumption.
	  At a given operating point the voltage is adapted depending on
	  static factors (chip manufacturing process) and dynamic factors
	  (temperature depending performance).
	  AVS is also called SmartReflex on OMAP devices.

	  Say Y here to enable Adaptive Voltage Scaling class support.

config POWER_AVS_MSM
	bool "Enable Adaptive Voltage Scaling (AVS) for QCOM chipsets"
	default n
	help
	  Enable AVS hardware to fine tune voltage at each frequency. The
	  AVS hardware blocks associated with each Qualcomm ARMv7 cores can
	  fine tune the voltages based on the feedback from the ring
	  oscillators.
