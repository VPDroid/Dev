config NET_VENDOR_MSM
	bool "MSM network devices"
	default n
	depends on ARCH_MSM
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about MSM network controllers. If you say Y, you will
	  be asked for your specific controller in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_MSM
config MSM_EMAC
	tristate "MSM EMAC Gigabit Ethernet support"
	default n
	select CRC32
	---help---
	  This driver supports the MSM EMAC Gigabit Ethernet controller.

	default n
	help
	  Implements RMNET over BAM interface.
	  RMNET provides a virtual ethernet interface
	  for routing IP packets within the MSM using
	  BAM as a physical transport.

config MSM_RMNET_MHI

	depends on IPA
	help
	  Enables LAN between applications processor and a tethered
	  host using the RNDIS protocol.
	  This Network interface is aimed to allow data path go through
	  IPA core while using RNDIS protocol.
