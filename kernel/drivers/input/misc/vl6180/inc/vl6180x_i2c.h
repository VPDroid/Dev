/**
 * @defgroup cci_i2c  CCI to RAW I2C translation layer
 *
 * This optional tranlation layer is implemented in __platform/cci-i2c__ directory. If user uses this translation layer for his platform, only @a VL6180x_I2CRead() and
 * @a VL6180x_I2CWrite() functions need to be implemented. Also, some code adaption (via macro) is required for multi-threading and for multiple device support.
 *
 * File vl6180x_i2c.c implements device register access via raw i2c access. If the targeted application and platform has no multi-thread,  no multi-cpu and uses single
 * device, then nothing else is required than the 2 mandatory function : @a VL6180x_I2CRead() and @a VL6180x_I2CWrite().\n
 * In other cases, review and customize @a VL6180x_GetI2CAccess() and @a VL6180x_DoneI2CAccess() functions as well as @a #VL6180x_I2C_USER_VAR macro. This should be enough
 * to conform to a wide range of platform OS and application requirements .\n
 *
 * If your configured i2c for per device buffer via  @a #I2C_BUFFER_CONFIG == 2, you must implement @a VL6180x_GetI2cBuffer()
 *
 * __I2C Port sample__ \n
 * A __linux kernel__ port need a "long flags" var for its spin_lock in all functions. the following code example declares a spin lock "lock" in the custom device structure. \n
 * @code
struct MyVL6180Dev_t {
     struct VL6180xDevData_t StData;
     ...
     spinlock_t i2c_lock;
};
typedef struct MyVL6180Dev_t *VL6180xDev_t;

#define DoneI2CAccess(dev)     spin_unlock_irqrestore(dev->i2c_lock,flags)
@endcode

*  __POSIX pthread__ application porting could be as follows :\n
* @code
struct MyVL6180Dev_t {
    struct VL6180xDevData_t StData;
    ...
    pthread_mutex_t *lock;
};
