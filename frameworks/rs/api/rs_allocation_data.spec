summary: Allocation Data Access Functions
description:
 The functions below can be used to get and set the cells that comprise
 an allocation.
 <ul>
 <li>Individual cells are accessed using the rsGetElementAt* and
   @rsSetElementAt functions.</li>
 <li>Multiple cells can be copied using the rsAllocationCopy* and
   rsAllocationV* functions.</li>
 <li>For getting values through a sampler, use @rsSample.</li>
 </ul>
 The @rsGetElementAt and rsSetElement* functions are somewhat misnamed.
 They don't get or set elements, which are akin to data types; they get
 or set cells.  Think of them as rsGetCellAt and and rsSetCellAt.

summary: Copy consecutive cells between allocations
description:
 Copies the specified number of cells from one allocation to another.

 The two allocations must be different.  Using this function to copy whithin
 the same allocation yields undefined results.

 The function does not validate whether the offset plus count exceeds the size
 of either allocation.  Be careful!

 This function should only be called between 1D allocations.  Calling it
 on other allocations is undefined.

summary: Copy a rectangular region of cells between allocations
description:
 Copies a rectangular region of cells from one allocation to another.
 (width * heigth) cells are copied.

 The two allocations must be different.  Using this function to copy whithin
 the same allocation yields undefined results.

 The function does not validate whether the the source or destination region
 exceeds the size of its respective allocation.  Be careful!

 This function should only be called between 2D allocations.  Calling it

arg: uint32_t x, "X offset in the allocation of the first cell to be copied from."
summary: Get a vector from an allocation of scalars
description:
 This function returns a vector composed of successive cells of the allocation.
 It assumes that the allocation contains scalars.

 The "X" in the name indicates that successive values are extracted by
 increasing the X index.  There are currently no functions to get successive
 values incrementing other dimensions.  Use multiple calls to rsGetElementAt()
 instead.

 For example, when calling rsAllocationVLoadX_int4(a, 20, 30), an int4 composed
 of a[20, 30], a[21, 30], a[22, 30], and a[23, 30] is returned.

 When retrieving from a three dimensional allocations, use the x, y, z variant.
 Similarly, use the x, y variant for two dimensional allocations and x for the
 mono dimensional allocations.

 For efficiency, this function does not validate the inputs.  Trying to wrap
 the X index, exceeding the size of the allocation, or using indices incompatible
 with the dimensionality of the allocation yields undefined results.

summary: Store a vector into an allocation of scalars
description:
 This function stores the entries of a vector into successive cells of an allocation.
 It assumes that the allocation contains scalars.

 The "X" in the name indicates that successive values are stored by increasing
 the X index.  There are currently no functions to store successive values
 incrementing other dimensions.  Use multiple calls to rsSetElementAt() instead.

 For example, when calling rsAllocationVStoreX_int3(a, v, 20, 30), v.x is stored
 at a[20, 30], v.y at a[21, 30], and v.z at a[22, 30].

 When storing into a three dimensional allocations, use the x, y, z variant.
 Similarly, use the x, y variant for two dimensional allocations and x for the
 mono dimensional allocations.

 For efficiency, this function does not validate the inputs.  Trying to wrap the
 X index, exceeding the size of the allocation, or using indexes incompatible
 with the dimensionality of the allocation yiels undefined results.
