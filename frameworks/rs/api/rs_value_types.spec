summary: Numerical Types

 <h5>Scalars:</h5>

 RenderScript supports the following scalar numerical types:
 <table>
 <tr><td>                 </td>  <td>8 bits        </td>   <td>16 bits         </td>   <td>32 bits       </td>   <td>64 bits</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Integer:         </td>  <td>char, @int8_t  </td>   <td>short, @int16_t  </td>   <td>@int32_t       </td>   <td>long, long long, @int64_t</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Unsigned integer:</td>  <td>uchar, @uint8_t</td>   <td>ushort, @uint16_t</td>   <td>uint, @uint32_t</td>   <td>ulong, @uint64_t</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Floating point:  </td>  <td>              </td>   <td>half            </td>   <td>float         </td>   <td>double</td></tr>
 </table>

 <h5>Vectors:</h5>

 RenderScript supports fixed size vectors of length 2, 3, and 4.
 Vectors are declared using the common type name followed by a 2, 3, or 4.
 E.g. @float4, @int3, @double2, @ulong4.

 To create vector literals, use the vector type followed by the values enclosed
 between parentheses, e.g. <code>(float3)(1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f)</code>.

 Entries of a vector can be accessed using different naming styles.

 Single entries can be accessed by following the variable name with a dot and:<ul>
 <li>The letters x, y, z, and w,</li>
 <li>The letters r, g, b, and a,</li>
 <li>The letter s or S, followed by a zero based index.</li></ul>

 For example, with <code>int4 myVar;</code> the following are equivalent:<code><br/>
   myVar.x == myVar.r == myVar.s0 == myVar.S0<br/>
   myVar.y == myVar.g == myVar.s1 == myVar.S1<br/>
   myVar.z == myVar.b == myVar.s2 == myVar.S2<br/>
   myVar.w == myVar.a == myVar.s3 == myVar.S3</code>

 Multiple entries of a vector can be accessed at once by using an identifier that is
 the concatenation of multiple letters or indices.  The resulting vector has a size
 equal to the number of entries named.

 With the example above, the middle two entries can be accessed using
 <code>myVar.yz</code>, <code>myVar.gb</code>, <code>myVar.s12</code>, and <code>myVar.S12</code>.

 The entries don't have to be contiguous or in increasing order.  Entries can even be
 repeated, as long as we're not trying to assign to it.  You also can't mix the naming
 styles.

 Here are examples of what can or can't be done:<code><br/>
 float4 v4;<br/>
 float3 v3;<br/>
 float2 v2;<br/>
 v2 = v4.xx; // Valid<br/>
 v3 = v4.zxw; // Valid<br/>
 v3 = v4.bba; // Valid<br/>
 v3 = v4.s032; // Valid<br/>
 v3.s120 = v4.S233; // Valid<br/>
 v4.yz = v3.rg; // Valid<br/>
 v4.yzx = v3.rg; // Invalid: mismatched sizes<br/>
 v4.yzz = v3; // Invalid: z appears twice in an assignment<br/>
 v3 = v3.xas0; // Invalid: can't mix xyzw with rgba nor s0...<br/>
 v3 = v4.s034; // Invalid: the digit can only be 0, 1, 2, or 3<br/>
 </code>

 <h5>Matrices and Quaternions:</h5>

 RenderScript supports fixed size square matrices of floats of size 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4.
 The types are named @rs_matrix2x2, @rs_matrix3x3, and @rs_matrix4x4.  See
 <a href='rs_matrix.html'>Matrix Functions</a> for the list of operations.

 Quaternions are also supported via @rs_quaternion.  See <a href='rs_quaternion.html'>Quaterion Functions</a> for the list
 of operations.
