 * GLConsumer consumes buffers of graphics data from a BufferQueue,
 * and makes them available to OpenGL as a texture.
 *
 * A typical usage pattern is to set up the GLConsumer with the
 * desired options, and call updateTexImage() when a new frame is desired.
 * If a new frame is available, the texture will be updated.  If not,
 * the previous contents are retained.
 *
 * By default, the texture is attached to the GL_TEXTURE_EXTERNAL_OES
 * texture target, in the EGL context of the first thread that calls
 * updateTexImage().
 *
 * This class was previously called SurfaceTexture.
