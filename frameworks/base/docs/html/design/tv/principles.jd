@jd:body


<p>Users bring a specific set of expectations when watching TV, versus interacting with a phone or
  tablet. The Android User Experience Team has developed the following guidelines for creation of
  the Android TV platform and the apps that run on it.
</p>


<h2>Casual Consumption</h2>

<p>The TV is an entertainment interface, not a computer or mobile device. Optimize for
  activities that put content at the center: from the casual posture of movie-watching, to
  immersive gameplay, to hanging out with friends in a living room.</p>

<p>Users expect immediate access to content when they turn on a TV. Get users into the action
  fast, be it the big game, their favorite show, or a game with friends. The next piece of content
  to watch or play should only be a click or two away.</p>


<h2>Cinematic Experience</h2>

<p>Create immersive experiences for the user. Design for as little user interface and as much
  content as possible on each screen. Use visual imagery, movement, and sound to inform and delight
  users. Avoid using on-screen text to convey information and purpose. Tell your story with pictures
  and sound.</p>


<h2>Simplicity</h2>

<p>Android TV is simple and magical. Itâ€™s all about finding and enjoying content and
  apps with the least amount of friction. Minimize the number of navigation steps required to
  perform actions. Build apps with the fewest screens possible between app entry and content
  immersion. Avoid making users enter text whenever possible, and use voice interfaces when you
  require text input.</p>
