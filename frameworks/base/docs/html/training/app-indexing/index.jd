</div>
</a>

<p>As mobile apps become more pervasive, users are looking for relevant
information not only from web sites but also from apps they have installed.
You can enable Google to crawl through your app content and present your
Android app as a destination to users through Google Search results, when
that content corresponds to a web page that you own.</p>

<p>You can make it possible for Google Search to open specific content in your
  app by providing intent filters for your activities. Google Search
app indexing complements this capability by presenting links to relevant app
content alongside links to your web pages in users' search results. Users on
mobile devices can then click on a link to open your app from their search
results, allowing them to directly view your app's content instead of a
web page.</p>

<p>To enable Google Search app indexing, you need to provide Google with
information about the relationship between your app and web site. This process
involves the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enable deep linking to specific content
in your app by adding intent filters in your app manifest.</li>
<li>Annotate these links in the associated web pages on your web site or in a
	Sitemap file.</li>
<li>Opt in to allow Googlebot to crawl through your APK in the Google Play store
	to index your app content. You are automatically opted-in when you join as
	a participant in the early adopter program.
</li>
</ol>

<p itemprop="description">This class shows how to enable deep linking and indexing of
your application content so that users can open this content directly from mobile search
results.</p>
