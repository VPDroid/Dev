<p>Welcome to Android application development!</p>

<p>This class teaches you how to build your first Android app. Youâ€™ll learn how to create an Android
project and run a debuggable version of the app. You'll also learn some fundamentals of Android app
design, including how to build a simple user interface and handle user input.</p>

<h2>Set Up Your Environment</h2>

<p>Before you start this class, be sure you have your development environment set up. You need
to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download <a href="{@docRoot}sdk/index.html">Android Studio</a>.</li>
  <li>Download the latest SDK tools and platforms using the
  <a href="{@docRoot}tools/help/sdk-manager.html">SDK Manager</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Although most of this training class
expects that you're using Android Studio, some procedures include alternative
instructions for using
the SDK tools from the command line instead.</p>

<p>This class uses a tutorial format to create a small Android app that teaches
you some fundamental concepts about Android development, so it's important that you follow each
step.</p>
