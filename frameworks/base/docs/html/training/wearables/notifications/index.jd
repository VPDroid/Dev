<p>When an Android handheld (phone or tablet) and Android wearable are connected, the handheld
automatically shares notifications with the wearable. On the wearable, each
notification appears as a new card in the <a href="{@docRoot}design/wear/index.html"
>context stream</a>.</p>

<p>However, to give users the best experience, you should add wearable-specific functionality to the
notifications you already create. The following lessons show you how to
create notifications that are catered for handhelds and wearables at the same time.
