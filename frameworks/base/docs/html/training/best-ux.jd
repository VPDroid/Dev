<p>These classes teach you how to engage and retain your users by implementing
the best interaction patterns for Android. For instance, to help users quickly discover content
in your app, your app should match their expectations for user interaction on Android.
And to keep your users coming back, you should take advantage of
platform capabilities that reveal and open your content without
requiring users to go through the app launcher.</p>
