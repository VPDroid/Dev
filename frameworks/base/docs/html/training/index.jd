<p>Welcome to Training for Android developers. Here you'll find sets of lessons within classes
that describe how to accomplish a specific task with code samples you can re-use in your app.
Classes are organized into several groups you can see at the top-level of the left navigation.</p>

 <p>This first group, <em>Getting Started</em>, teaches you the bare
    essentials for Android app development. If you're a new Android app developer, you should
