<p>
Watching live TV shows and other continuous, channel-based content is a big part of the TV
experience. Users are accustomed to selecting and watching shows on TV by channel browsing.
To provide your users a similar experience, use the TV Input Framework to create channels for
publishing video or music content so that your media appears alongside traditional TV channels in
the programming guide.
</p>
<p>
Android supports receiving and playback of live video content through the TV Input Framework in
Android 5.0 (API level 21). This framework provides a unified method for receiving audio and video
channel content from hardware sources, such as HDMI ports and built-in-tuners, and software
sources, such as video streamed over the internet.
</p>
<p>
  The framework enables developers to define live TV input sources by implementing a TV input
  service. This service publishes a list of channels and programs to the TV Provider. The live TV
  app on a TV device gets the list of available channels and programs from the TV Provider and
  displays them to a user. When a user selects a specific channel, the live TV app creates a
  session for the associated TV input service through the TV Input Manager, and tells the TV input
  service to tune to the requested channel and play the content to a display surface provided by
  the TV app.

<p>
  The TV Input Framework is designed to provide access to a wide variety of live TV input sources
  and bring them together in a single user interface for users to browse, view, and enjoy content.
  Building a TV input service for your content can help make it more accessible on TV devices.
