<p>
  TV devices offer many entertainment options for users. They have thousands of content options
  from apps and related content services. At the same time, most users prefer to use TVs with the
  least amount of input possible. With the number of choices available to users, it is important for
  app developers to provide quick and easy paths for users to discover and enjoy your content.
</p>

<p>
  The Android framework helps you provide a number of paths for users to discover your content,
  including recommendations on the home screen and searching within your app's content catalog.
</p>

  This class shows you how to help users discover your app's content through recommendations and
  in-app searching.
