<p>Playing videos and music is a popular activity on Android devices. The Android framework
  provides {@link android.media.MediaPlayer} as a quick solution for playing media with minimal
  code, and the {@link android.media.MediaCodec} and {@link android.media.MediaExtractor} classes
  are provided for building custom media players. The open source project, ExoPlayer, is a
  solution between these two options, providing a pre-built player that you can extend.</p>

<p>ExoPlayer supports features not currently provided by {@link android.media.MediaPlayer},
  including Dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH), SmoothStreaming and Common Encryption. It's
  designed to be easy to customize and extend, allowing many components to be replaced with custom
  implementations. Because ExoPlayer is a library that you include in your application, it can be
  easily updated along with your app.</p>

  <strong>Note:</strong> ExoPlayer is an open source project that is not part of the Android
  framework and is distributed separately from the Android SDK. Visit the links below to find out
