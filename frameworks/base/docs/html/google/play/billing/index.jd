  <h2><strong>New in In-App Billing</strong></h2>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Subscription Upgrade/Downgrade</strong>&mdash;A user can
    subscribe to a higher or lower tier of subscription while their current
    subscription is active. The old subscription is canceled, and the unused
    portion is applied on a pro-rated basis to the new subscription.</li>
  <li><strong>Manual Subscription Renewal</strong>&mdash;A user can purchase
    a subscription at the current rate while their existing subscription is
    still active. The existing subscription is extended by the appropriate
    period.</li>
  <li><strong>IAB Sandbox</strong>&mdash;The In-app Billing Sandbox now supports
    testing subscription purchases.</li>
  <li><strong>IAB v2 shutdown</strong>&mdash;In-app Billing v2 API is deprecated
    and will be shut down in January 2015. If your app is still using In-app Billing
    v2, please migrate to the v3 API as soon as possible.</li>
  <li><strong>Seasonal subscriptions</strong>&mdash;You can now set up a
    recurring <a href="billing_subscriptions.html#user-billing">seasonal
    subscription</a> that starts and ends on the same date each year (for
    example, a sports subscription that starts every September 1 and ends every
    April 10).</li>
  <li><strong>Deferred subscription billing</strong>&mdash;You can
    <a href="billing_subscriptions.html#deferred-billing">defer</a> a
    subscriber's next billing date until the date you choose. The user still has
    access to the content but is not charged during the deferral period.</li>
  <li><strong>Weekly subscriptions</strong>&mdash;You can now set up a
    recurring <a href="billing_subscriptions.html#user-billing">subscription</a>
    that bills the user every week.</li>
  <li><strong>Payment grace period</strong>&mdash;If a subscriber misses a
    subscription payment due to an expired credit card, you can define a
    <a href="billing_subscriptions.html#grace-period">grace period</a>
    to the continue the subscription until payment is successful.</li>

<p>When you use the in-app billing service to sell an item,
whether it's an in-app product or a subscription, Google Play
handles all checkout details so your application never has to directly process
any financial transactions. Google Play uses the same checkout backend service as
is used for application purchases, so your users experience a consistent and
familiar purchase flow.</p>

<p>Any application that you publish through Google Play can implement In-app Billing. No special
account or registration is required other than a Google Play Developer Console account and a Google
Wallet merchant account.</p>

<p>To help you integrate in-app billing into your application, the Android SDK
provides a sample application that demonstrates how to sell standard in-app
products and subscriptions from inside an app.</p>
