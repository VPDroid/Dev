@jd:body



  <p>The NDK is a toolset that allows you to implement parts
  of your app using native-code languages such as C and C++. Typically, good use cases for the NDK
  are CPU-intensive applications such as game engines, signal processing, and physics simulation.
  </p>

  <p>Before downloading the NDK, you should understand that <strong>the NDK
   will not benefit most apps</strong>. As a developer, you need to balance its benefits
  against its drawbacks. Notably, using native code on Android
  generally does not result in a noticable performance improvement,
  but it always increases your app complexity. In general, you should only use the NDK
  if it is essential to your app&mdash;never because you simply prefer to program in C/C++.
  When examining whether or not you should develop in native code, think about your requirements and
  see if the Android framework APIs provide the functionality that you need.</p>
