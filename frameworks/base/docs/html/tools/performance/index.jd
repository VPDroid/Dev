  <p>Putting pixels on the screen involves four primary pieces of hardware.
  To greatly simplify, the CPU computes display lists, the GPU renders images to
  the display, the memory stores images and data, and the battery provides
  electrical power. Each of these pieces of hardware has constraints; pushing
  or exceeding those constraints causes your app to be slow, have
  bad display performance, or exhaust the battery.

  <p>To discover what causes your specific performance problems, you need to
  take a look under the hood, use tools to collect data about your app's
  execution behavior, surface that data as lists and
  graphics, understand and analyze what you see, and improve your code.</p>

  <p>Android Studio and your device provide profiling tools to record and
  visualize the rendering, compute, memory, and battery performance of your
  app.</p>
