<p>The Android SDK is composed of individual packages that may undergo
an update at their own schedule, so some have their own set of release notes. You can
find information about some of the packages in this section, including the core <a
href="{@docRoot}tools/sdk/tools-notes.html">SDK Tools</a> and the latest <a
href="{@docRoot}tools/revisions/platforms.html">SDK Platforms</a>. Release notes are also available
for Android developer tools, such as
<a href="{@docRoot}tools/revisions/studio.html">Android Studio</a> and the
<a href="{@docRoot}tools/revisions/gradle-plugin.html">Android Plugin for Gradle</a>.
