@jd:body


<p>The Android SDK includes a variety of tools that help you develop mobile
applications for the Android platform. The tools are classified into two groups: SDK tools
and platform tools. SDK tools are platform independent and are required no matter which
Android platform you are developing on. Platform tools are customized to support the features of the
latest Android platform.</p>


<h2 id="tools-sdk">SDK Tools</h2>
<p>The SDK tools are installed with the SDK starter package and are periodically updated.
The SDK tools are required if you are developing Android applications. The most important SDK tools
include the Android SDK Manager (<code>android sdk</code>), the AVD Manager (<code>android
avd</code>) the emulator (<code>emulator</code>), and the Dalvik Debug Monitor Server
(<code>ddms</code>). A short summary of some frequently-used SDK tools is provided below.</p>

</dl>



<h2 id="tools-platform">Platform Tools</h2>

<p>The platform tools are typically updated every time you install a new SDK platform. Each update
of the platform tools is backward compatible with older platforms. Usually, you directly use only
one of the platform tools&mdash;the <a href="adb.html">Android Debug Bridge (<code>adb</code>)</a>.
Android Debug Bridge is a versatile tool that lets you manage the state of an emulator instance or
Android-powered device. You can also use it to install an Android application (.apk) file on a
device.</p>

<p>The other platform tools, such as <a href="{@docRoot}guide/components/aidl.html">aidl</a>,
<code>aapt</code>, <code>dexdump</code>, and <code>dx</code>, are typically called by the Android
build tools or Android Development Tools (ADT), so you rarely need to invoke these tools directly.
As a general rule, you should rely on the build tools or the ADT plugin to call them as needed.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The Android SDK provides additional shell tools that can
be accessed through <code>adb</code>, such as <a href="{@docRoot}tools/help/bmgr.html">bmgr</a> and
<a href="{@docRoot}tools/help/logcat.html">logcat</a>.</p>
<dl>
  <dt><a href="{@docRoot}tools/help/bmgr.html">bmgr</a></dt>
    <dd>A shell tool you can use to interact with the Backup Manager on Android devices supporting
    API Level 8 or greater.</dd>

  <dt><a href="{@docRoot}tools/help/logcat.html">logcat</a></dt>
    <dd>Provides a mechanism for collecting and viewing system debug output.</dd>
