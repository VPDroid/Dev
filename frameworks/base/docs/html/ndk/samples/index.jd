page.title=Samples: Overview
@jd:body

<p>Welcome to the NDK samples area. Here, you can download a variety of sample
apps to help deepen your understanding the NDK.


<p>From this page, you can download samples that provide a look at the NDK in action. A few of the
topics covered are:</p>

<ul>
   <li>Managing your native app's activity lifecycle.</li>
   <li>Using native OpenGL on an Android device.</li>
   <li>Implementing native audio.</li>
   <li>Exporting modules.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong>These samples are also contained in the NDK installation
package; if you have already downloaded the NDK, you have them. They reside in
{@code $NDK/samples/}, where {@code $NDK} is the NDK installation root.</p>
