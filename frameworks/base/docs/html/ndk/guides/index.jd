page.title=Getting Started with the NDK
@jd:body

<p>The Native Development Kit (NDK) is a set of tools that allow you to leverage C and
C++ code in your Android apps. You can use it either to build from your own source code, or to take
advantage of existing prebuilt libraries.</p>

<p>The NDK is not appropriate for most novice Android programmers, and has little value for many
types of Android apps. It is often not worth the additional complexity it inevitably brings to the
development process. However, it can be useful in cases in which you need to:</p>

<ul>
   <li>Squeeze extra performance out of a device for computationally intensive applications like
   games or physics simulations.</li>
   <li>Reuse your own or other developers' C or C++ libraries.</li>
</ul>

<p>This guide gives you the information you need to get up and running with the NDK. It starts by
explaining the <a href="{@docRoot}ndk/guides/concepts.html">concepts</a> underpinning the NDK, and
how to <a href="{@docRoot}ndk/guides/setup.html">set it up</a>. Next, it continues with information
about targeting <a href="{@docRoot}ndk/guides/arch.html">different hardware platforms</a> in your
builds. Then, it explains how to use
the NDK to <a href="{@docRoot}ndk/guides/build.html">build</a> and
<a href="{@docRoot}ndk/guides/debug.html">debug</a> your app. Finally, it discusses how to use your
own and other prebuilt <a href="{@docRoot}ndk/guides/libs.html">libraries</a>.</p>
