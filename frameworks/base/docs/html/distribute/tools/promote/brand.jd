 <p>The following are guidelines for the Android brand
 and related assets.</p>


  <h4 style="clear:right">Android in text</h4>

  </div>
    <ul>
    <li>Android&trade; should have a trademark symbol the first time it appears in a creative.</li>
    <li>Android should always be capitalized and is never plural or possessive.</li>
    <li>"Android" cannot be used in names of applications or accessory products,
    including phones, tablets, TVs, speakers, headphones, watches, and other devices. Instead use "for Android".
      <ul>
        <li><span style="color:red">Incorrect</span>: "Android MediaPlayer"</li>
        <li><span style="color:green">Correct</span>: "MediaPlayer for Android"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If used with your logo, "for Android" should be no larger than 90% of your logo’s size.
      First instance of this use should be followed by a TM symbol, "for Android&trade;".</p>
    </li>
    <li>"Android TV", "Android Wear" and "Android Auto" may only be used to identify or market
      products or services with prior approval.  Use "for Android" or "with Android" for all
      other Android-based products
      <ul>
        <li><span style="color:red">Incorrect</span>: "Android TV Streaming Stick",
          "Streaming Stick with Android TV"</li>
        <li><span style="color:green">Correct</span>: "Streaming Stick with Android"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If used with your logo, "for Android" or "with Android" should be no larger than 90% of
        your logo’s size. First instance of this use should be followed by a TM symbol,
        "for Android&trade;".</p>
    </li>
    <li>Android may be used as a descriptor, as long as it is followed by a
        proper generic term. (Think of "Android" as a term used in place of
        "the Android platform.")
      <ul>
        <li><span style="color:red">Incorrect</span>: "Android MediaPlayer" or "Android XYZ app"</li>
        <li><span style="color:green">Correct</span>: "Android features" or "Android applications"</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Any use of the Android name needs to include this
    attribution in your communication:</p>
    <blockquote><em>Android is a trademark of Google Inc.</em></blockquote></p>

  <p>Use the "Get it on Google Play" and "Android App on Google Play" badges on your website and
  promotional materials to point to your products on Google Play. These badges are both available
  in over 40 languages. Additional Google Play badge formats and
    badges for music, books, magazines, movies, and TV shows are also available.
    Use the  <a
    href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/contact/brand_developer">Android
    and Google Play Brand Permissions Inquiry form</a> to request
    those badges.</p>

  <p>Google Play badge guidelines:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Don't modify the color, proportions, spacing, or any other aspect of the badge.</li>
    <li>When used alongside logos for other application marketplaces, the Google Play badge
    should be of equal or greater size.</li>
    <li>When used online, the badge should link to either:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>A list of products published by you, for example:<br />
        <span style="margin-left:1em;">http://play.google.com/store/search?q=<em>publisherName</em></span>
        </li>
        <li>A specific app product details page within Google Play, for example:<br />
        <span style="margin-left:1em;">http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=<em>packageName</em></span>
        </li>
      </ul>
    <li>You do not need to include a legal attribution if you are only using a Google Play badge.
    However, keep in mind that:</li>
     <ul>
     <li>If you make any mention of Google Play or Android outside of the badge a legal attribution
     must be included. </li>
     <li>If you are including another app store’s legal attribution then include this legal
     attribution:</li>
      <ul>
      <li>Google Play is a trademark of Google Inc.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Use of the Google Play badge does not need to be reviewed or approved by the Google Play
    brand team unless the marketing campaign will have over 1 million impressions.</li>
  </ul>

  use the <a
