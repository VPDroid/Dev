  Virtual reality promises to transform the way players view games, taking them from a
  flat world into the realm of 3D. In fact, any application that provides
  a way to visually explore has the possibility to offer users more immersive experiences
  with VR &mdash; like a virtual tour of a famous landmark or a way to visualise atoms in a
  chemical compound.
