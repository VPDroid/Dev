  can explore Google Play on the web. Android users can even buy and install
  the apps they want and Google Play pushes them automatically to their devices
  with no cables required.
</p>

    User Ratings and Reviews
  </h2>


</div>

<p>
  Prospective users look at ratings and reviews as key benchmarks of app
  quality. By rating apps from one to five stars and posting reviews, Android
  users show their appreciation for the apps they have downloaded.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Your app's rating is one of the most important factors influencing
  its ranking</strong> in the Google Play lists and search results. It's also
  one of the key metrics that the editorial staff looks for when curating apps
  and games for promotion in the store.

    Category Browsing
  </h2>


</div>

<p>
  When you publish an app in Google Play, you pick the category where you want
  users to find your app. More than 30 categories are available. Inside each
  category, apps are ranked based on a combination of ratings, reviews,
  downloads, country, and other factors.
</p>

<div class="headerLine">
  <h2 id="search">
    Search
  </h2>


</div>

<p>
  Search on Google Play lets users pinpoint an app or game quickly. Search uses
  powerful heuristics to suggest terms as the user types, and it offers direct
  links to apps as suggestions. In results, users find the most relevant, most
  popular apps at the top.
</p>

<div class="headerLine">
  <h2 id="top-charts-and-lists">
    Top Charts and Lists
  </h2>


</div>

<div class="figure">
  <img src="{@docRoot}images/gp-about-top.jpg">
</div>

<p>
  Top charts keep users in touch with what’s popular and trending with Android
  users, right from the Apps and Games home pages. The charts stay fresh,
  updating several times each day based on recent download activity. As an
  app's ratings and download activity grow, it can move up in the charts.
</p>

<p>
  To make the charts as relevant as possible for users across the world, they
  are also country-specific in Google Play's most popular countries. As your
  apps get traction and build momentum in downloads and ratings, they’ll climb
  one or more of the top charts and gain even more exposure.

<p>
  Your app’s Google Play storefront is its <em>store listing page</em>: a rich
  and colorful page that lets you promote your app, highlight its ratings and
  reviews, and show what your app can do.
</p>

<p>
  Your store listing is where your users come to find out everything about your
  app. When they see your app listed in search results, top charts, category
  listings, and collections, one tap takes them directly to your store listing.
</p>

<p>
  Manage your product details page through the <a href=
  "https://play.google.com/apps/publish/">Google Play Developer Console</a>
  from any web browser. Sign in to upload or update your brand assets, and
  enter your product details in the languages of your markets.
</p>

<p>
  When you publish, Google Play adds your app’s ratings, reviews, links to your
  other products, and more. It also makes sure your store listing page looks
  great on phones, tablets, and in a web browser.
</p>

<p>
  You can link web users directly to your product details page from outside
  Google Play, such as from your web site, an ad campaign, reviews, social
  media posts, and more. See <a href=
