<p>
  By participating in Google Play for Education you’ll be placing your apps
  before a new audience of teachers and educators. To address this audience,
  there are specific guidelines and policies your apps should meet and specific
  design considerations too.
</p>

<h3>
  Understand guidelines and policies
</h3>

<p>
  To prepare for a launch on Google Play for Education, start by reviewing the
  guidelines for educational apps in Google Play and the policies that apply to
  your apps. See the <a href=
  "https://developers.google.com/edu/guidelines">Education
  Guidelines</a> for details.
</p>

<p>
  Also, make sure that you're familiar with the policies that your app must
  comply with. For Android, they include <a href=
  "http://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy.html">content
  policies</a>, the <a href=
  "http://play.google.com/about/developer-distribution-agreement.html">Developer
  Distribution Agreement</a>, and <a href=
  "https://play.google.com/about/developer-distribution-agreement-addendum.html">
  Google Play for Education Addendum</a>.
</p>
<p>For Chrome, they include <a href=
  "https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/program_policies">content
  policies</a>, the <a href=
  "https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/terms">Developer
  Distribution Agreement</a>, and <a href=

<h3>
  Design and develop a great app for education
</h3>

<p>
  Great apps for educators and students <strong>offer educational
  value</strong>, are <strong>designed for K-12 classroom use</strong>,
  <strong>deliver a compelling feature set</strong>, and are refined to offer a
  polished, <strong>high-quality tablet experience</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Assess your app against the criteria listed in the <a href=
  "https://developers.google.com/edu/guidelines">Education
  Guidelines</a> and plan on supporting them to the greatest extent possible.
  In some cases you might need to modify the app’s features or UI to support
  classroom requirements. It's a good idea to identify any changes early in
  development, so that you can address them properly.
</p>

<p>
  With Google Play for Education, optimizing your Android apps for tablets is crucial.
  A variety of resources are available to help you understand what you need to
  do — a good starting point is the <a href=
  "{@docRoot}distribute/essentials/quality/tablets.html">Tablet App Quality</a>
  guidelines.
</p>

<p>
  Throughout design and development, it's important to have suitable devices on
  which to prototype and test your user experience. It's recommended highly
  that you acquire 7-inch and 10-inch tablet devices and set up your testing
  environment as early as possible. The recommended 7-inch hardware device that
  replicates the Google Play for Education environment is the Nexus 7, which is
  available from <a href=
  "https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_7_16gb_2013">Google
  Play</a> and other stores.
</p>

<p>
For Chrome apps, optimizing your apps for mouse, keyboard, and touch is just as important.
Some students will use touch as their primary input method, and some will have Chromebooks
without touch. Make sure your app works for all students.
</p>
<p>
  Comprehensive testing and quality assurance are key aspects of delivering
  great apps for teachers and students. Make sure you set up a <a href=
  "{@docRoot}distribute/essentials/gpfe-guidelines.html#test-environment">proper
  test environment</a> to, ensure that your apps meet the guidelines under
  realistic conditions.

<p>
  Once you have designed, built, and tested your apps, you take two steps to
  publish them:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Before you opt-in any apps, agree to the <a href=
  "https://play.google.com/about/developer-distribution-agreement-addendum.html"
    target="_policies">Google Play for Education Addendum</a>. Ensure you
    review the Addendum completely and make any necessary modifications to your
    apps.
  </li>

  <li>Publish your apps in the Developer Console (for Android apps) or the Chrome Web Store
  (for Chrome apps) as normal, but opt-in to
  Google Play for Education.
  </li>
</ul>
