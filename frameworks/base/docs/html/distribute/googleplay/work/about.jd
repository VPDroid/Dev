<p>Google Play for Work is an extension of Google Play that lets Android for Work users browse and install apps. IT admins in a business using Android for Work choose which public and private apps are made available to users in their business. Businesses can use Google Play for Work to securely bulk deploy free apps to their employees or bulk purchase paid apps depending on their needs.</p>

<h2 id="best_practices">Best practices for success</h2>

<p>Keep these best practices in mind as you build a great enterprise-ready app.</p>

<h3 id="design">Develop a great app for business</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Follow best practices for security and manage user data properly. Businesses
  are more conscious of data security and employee productivity, especially when it
  comes to features that share information with other services.</li>
  <li>Support the <a href="{@docRoot}training/enterprise/app-restrictions.html">App Configuration framework</a> to let an administrator remotely configure app settings such as:
    <ul>
      <li>Server address and protocol settings</li>
      <li>The ability to switch features on and off</li>
      <li>Sign-in credentials for your app's backend servers</li>
      <li>Default user settings</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Request the minimum permissions that your app needs.</li>
  <li>Make sure communication to your backend and data in your backend is secure.</li>
  <li>Implement authorization policies that will minimize the number of your employees that can access user data.</li>
  <li><a href={@docRoot}training/enterprise/app-compatibility.html">Offer compatibility with work profile</a> and test that with the <a href="{@docRoot}samples/BasicManagedProfile/index.html">BasicManagedProfile sample app</a>.</li>
  <li>Support <a href="{@docRoot}training/enterprise/app-restrictions.html">app restrictions</a> so that IT admins can remotely configure your app through leading EMM solutions.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="support">Provide support and maintenance</h3>

<ul>
<li>Consider offering enhanced support to cover extended hours or specific means of contact. Businesses are often willing to pay for this service.</li>
<li>If you update the App Configuration / App Restrictions schema for your app, make sure it remains backward compatible. This is because it’s possible that different users will have different versions of your app (at least temporarily), and IT admin will want a consistent remote configuration experience between versions to ensure efficient management of apps in the field.</li>
</ul>
