  Direct Carrier Billing
  </h2>


</div>

<p>
  Users pay by charging their monthly carrier bills . The benefit of Direct
  Carrier Billing is that it opens up markets where credit cards are less
  common, as purchases are charged to your customers’ monthly mobile phone
  bills. This option is available to users in key markets
  around the world. Many more will get the option in the months ahead.
