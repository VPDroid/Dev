    Product purchase with Android Pay

<p>
  With Android Pay, you've the added flexibility of selling
  physical goods and services, such as clothing or movie tickets, through your
  apps using <a href=
  "https://developers.google.com/wallet/instant-buy/">the Android Pay API</a>
  <strong>(US Only)</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  You can use this option where your app is the store-front for retail or
  webtail operations. However, you can also combine it with your <a href=
  "{@docRoot}distribute/monetize/premium.html">premium</a> and <a href=
  "{@docRoot}distribute/monetize/freemium.html">freemium</a> apps by offering
  related products.
</p>
<p>
  Your customers purchase goods and services with credit or debit card payment
  methods. Android Pay helps you minimize user data entry by enabling your payment flow
  to retrieve information directly from the user's Google account.
</p>
<p>
  You also keep your existing payment infrastructure and leverage Android Pay
  to optimize your payment flow &mdash; users can make purchases in as a few as
  two clicks and the flow is simplified with features to retrieve information
  directly from the userâ€™s wallet and intelligent auto-completion of addresses.</p>
