<p>
  Users are more likely to download free apps and games compared to priced
  ones. However, we provide you with a number of ways to monetize free apps,
  using <a href="{@docRoot}google/play/billing/index.html">In-app
  Billing</a>. With this tool you can sell digital goods that are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Durable &mdash; once purchased the item will always be available to the
  user, such as additional app features.
  </li>

  <li>Consumable &mdash; items that might be used progressively or expire after
  a period of time, such as a game booster or news subscription.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  A basic approach is to offer a free download with limited features or full
  features for a limited time. Then use an in-app purchase to unlock the full,
  unlimited app.

  A more advanced approach is to offer a range of features and content items
  through in-app purchases. For example, in games you can offer users new
  levels, playing pieces, or other game features. In apps you can offer
  features or functionality that enhance the user experience either by
  extending existing features or offering new ones. Using this approach you can
  generate a continuing revenue stream from each app install.
</p>

<p>
  Any item offered as an in-app purchase can also be offered as a subscription.

<p>
  To get started with In-app Billing you need to set-up a Google payments
  <a href="{@docRoot}distribute/googleplay/start.html#merchant-account">Merchant
  Account</a> from Developer Console. You then define <a href=
  "{@docRoot}distribute/googleplay/developer-console.html#in-app-products">in-app
  products</a> in the Developer Console, integrate the In-app Billing API into
  your apps, and add the mechanisms to unlock features or deliver content.
