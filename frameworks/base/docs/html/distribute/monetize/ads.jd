  Tips
</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Place ads wisely, they shouldn't be too intrusive but still need to be
  clearly visible to attract clickthroughs.
  </li>

  <li>Use banner, interstitial, and other ad formats appropriately.
  </li>

  <li>Make use of targeting features to match ads with your users and your app.
  </li>

  <li>Remember that ads form part of your app and must match its age rating.
  </li>

  <li>Exercise control options sensibly, don't get carried away excluding
  potentially competing ads at the expense of revenue.
  </li>
  <li>If you also need to manage direct deals with advertisers, consider using
