<p>Google Search now helps users discover your app, with App Indexing. When users
search with Google on their Android device the results will include details of
relevant, indexed apps. The search results will include an install button that
takes users to your app in the Google Play store. And when your app is
installed, the user will be taken straight to the right content within it.</p>

<p>This free service expands your opportunities to turn the investment you’ve made
in creating an outstanding app or game into installs. </p>

<p>Start now by adding deep linking support to your app, verifying your app’s
official website, and defining deep links. To learn how, check out these <a
href="https://developers.google.com/app-indexing/webmasters/details">instructions</a>. </p>

<p>Once your app is index, links to its content will join the 30 billion app index
links already available to Google Search.</p>

<h2 id=tips>Tips</h2>

<ul>
  <li> App Indexing will also be used as a ranking signal for all users on Android,
regardless of whether they have your app installed or not. 
  <li> App Indexing also helps drive use of your app — when your app is installed on a
user’s device, search results will include deep links to your app that bring
the user straight to the relevant app content.
  <li> Use the App Indexing API to help users discover relevant content in your app
before they complete a query with auto-completions.
</ul>
