<p>
  Your Google Play app listings are a vital part of your app marketing, from
  organic traffic or visits you generate through marketing and promotion.
  Potential users will quickly move on from a poor listing, so the importance
  of having a great one can't be ignored.

    Graphics &amp; Imagery Tips

<p>
  Be sure to supply a variety of high-quality graphic assets to showcase your
  apps or brand on Google Play search results and your product details pages.
  These graphic assets are key parts of successful product details pages that
  attracts and engages users, so consider having a professional produce them
  for you.

<h3>
  Icons
</h3>

<p>
  For most users, the <a href=
  "{@docRoot}design/style/iconography.html#launcher">launcher icon</a>
  (sometimes referred to as the app icon) is the first impression of your app.
  As higher density screens on both phones and tablets gain popularity, it's
  important to make sure your launcher icon is crisp and high quality. To do
  this, make sure you’re including XHDPI (320dpi) and XXHDPI (480dpi) versions
  of the icon in your apps. Learn more about <a href=

<h3>
  Screenshots and videos
</h3>

<p>
  Be sure to showcase how your apps look, their important features, and what
  makes them different. Showcase any game play, characters, and their
  personalities. Some developers build special screens to highlight what’s
  happening in the screenshot, and extra video footage to highlight the brand.

      <strong>Tip:</strong> If your app runs on both phones and tablets, be
      sure to include screenshots from both devices, including both horizontal
      and portrait aspect ratios.

<h3>
  Featured image
</h3>

<p>
  Choosing the right featured image is important, it needs to convey as much
  about the features of your apps and what makes them special as possible,
  without being cluttered and confusing. To get started with the featured
  image specs, read the <a

      <strong>Tip:</strong> Translate any embedded text, use different imagery
      or presentation, and match any marketing promotion to the needs of users
      in other markets. For example: Some eastern markets respond to price
      points that end in .00 or .05 more than .99.

  Many developers start in their country of strength, then expand into new
  markets. To help you market your apps more effectively to a global audience,
  create <a href=
  "http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2012/12/localize-your-promotional-graphics-on.html">
  localized versions of your promotional graphics, screenshots, and videos</a>.
  When a user visits your product display pages, Google Play will show the
  localized assets that you’ve provided for that country. Find out more about

    Keyword Tips
  </h2>


</div>

<p>
  Think carefully about the keywords you use for your apps. Think about words
  that represent the core feature of your apps. Also consider other words that
  the user might use to search for your app. For example, if you have a Live
  Wallpaper app, you may want to include the term ‘background’. This way, users
  who don’t yet know the terminology can find your app.
