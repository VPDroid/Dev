<p>
  A key part of growing your apps' installed base is knowing more about your
  users &mdash; how they discover your app, what devices they use, what they do
  when they use your app, and how often they return to it.

  Read Ratings Comments
  </h2>

<p>
  The most obvious way to get to know your users is by reading review comments
  for your apps on Google Play. While the details provided in reviews will vary
  greatly, in addition to telling you about what users like and dislike in your
  apps, they can also provide insight into your users’ motivations for using
  your apps. And remember that users can update their ratings and comments
  about an app when you fix issues.

</div>

<p>
  Another great way to get to know your users, learn who they are, and what
  they are looking for, is to start a community. There are many support tools
  you can use, from forums such as <a href="http://groups.google.com/">Google
  Groups</a> to comprehensive customer support products. You can integrate some
  directly into your apps. And once you deploy a support tool, make sure to
  fill in the support link in your Google Play product details page.

  <h2 id="create-survey">
  Create a Survey
  </h2>


</div>

<p>
  Consider using a survey to gather information about your users and their
  views on your apps. Compared to app reviews, a questionnaire enables you to
  seek specific information. However use with care, as the creation of suitable
  question is something of an art. Also consider providing an appropriate
  incentive for completing the questionnaire, as too few responses can be worse
  than no responses at all.
</p>

<p>
  You can create a questionnaire with <a href=
  "http://www.google.com/drive/apps.html#forms">Google Drive Forms</a> or use
  one of the various third-party survey and questionnaire hosting tools
  available, such as SurveyMonkey.

  <h2 id="add-analytics">
  Add Analytics to your Apps
  </h2>


</div>

<p>
  Analytics data can tell you a lot about your users, by exposing their
  behaviour in your apps. You can use <a href=
  "http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2013/10/improved-app-insight-by-linking-google.html">
  Google Analytics by linking it with your Google Play account</a> or use a
  third-party analytics tool. Analytics tools can help you gather information
  on app installs, feature popularity, unused features, and more. You can see
  any usage pattern differences by region, device, time day and other
  variables.

  <h2 id="use-google">
  Use Google+
  </h2>


</div>

<p>
  <a href="https://plus.google.com/">Google+</a> is a great way to gather user
  feedback, announce surveys and contests, and see how users react to new
  features and functionality. Many developers manage a Google+ page to
  communicate with their users. It’s also a good way to get feedback from your
  beta-testing. Some developers have a page for each of their apps. This is
  especially true for game developers, who post challenges and tournaments.
  Google+ can also be used to post game walkthroughs and tips.
