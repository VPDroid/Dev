<p>
  Now you can bring users who discover your app videos on YouTube to your store
  listing with a merchandise card, one of several card types available to add
  to YouTube videos. Once published the presence of the merchandise card is
  indicated in the video with an information icon. When a viewer opens the card
  they follow the link to your app on the Play Store, where they can install
  your app.

  Tips
</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Donâ€™t indicate the location of a card within your video, cards might be
  positioned differently on different devices.
  </li>

  <li>When you add cards, featured video or playlist highlights in your video
  are hidden.
  </li>

  <li>In order to display cards, your account needs to be in good standing.
  </li>

  <li>Performance reporting for cards is available in YouTube Analytics.
  </li>

  <li>Cards work better when they're not too close to each other. Try spacing
  them out.
  </li>
</ul>
