<p>Google sign-in is a trusted registration system that's familiar to users and
consistent across devices. With minimal effort, you can improve your sign-in conversion
with a fast and secure authentication option for users. And by using Google sign-in,
you can offer users the option to send your app directly to their Android devices when
they sign-in, without the need for them to visit the Play store. Using this approach,
some developers have seen app installation acceptance rates of 40%.</p>
