<p>
  Fans of your apps love to help others, turn newer users into fans, and bring
  you more users as they talk about your app. Building a community can help you
  tap into those influencers to help you improve your app and provide support
  to others.
</p>

  Building your own community can help you bring content that will delight
  users and get them talking about your apps to friends, family and others in
  their social network.

  Starting Your Community

<p>
  In conjunction with your apps’ design and development, you should start
  defining and building your community infrastructure. There’s no one approach
  that fits all, and the approach for each of your apps may need to be a little
  different. You should start by thinking about your potential users and asking
  questions such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  <p>
    How will my users prefer to interact? Game users may prefer a modern feed
    style community, users of a financial management app a more traditional
    discussion forum.
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
    Should I have a community for all my apps or should each app have its
    own? Will users be turned off if the community isn’t just about the app
    that interests them or can I make it a way to turn them onto my other
    apps?
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
    Will different countries or territories, or speakers of particular
    languages need separate forums? How will I handle feedback in languages I
    don’t know?
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
    Do I need any additional policies beyond those governing the tool used to
    host the community?
  </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Any way you do it, starting your community early helps you build momentum as
  you turn happy users into influencers.
</p>

<p>
  Consider inviting your existing users through a rich notification or an
  opt-in on your website. Don’t overlook inviting your critics too. If you have
  been able to address their earlier issues you may convert them into
  supporters — it’s not unknown for your harshest critics to become your most
  enthusiastic fans if you address their concerns.
</p>

<p>
  When you use the <a href=
  "{@docRoot}distribute/googleplay/developer-console.html#alpha-beta">beta-testing
  feature</a> in Google Play, you’ll create a testers group through a <a href=
  "https://support.google.com/groups/answer/46601">Google Group</a> or <a href=
  "https://support.google.com/plus/topic/2888488">Google+ Community</a> to
  define who gets your software for testing. Consider managing these groups as
  communities in their own right.

  Tools to Build Your Community
  </h2>


</div>

<p>
  There are many tools you can use to build your community. Before you launch,
  inviting <a href="http://www.google.com/+/business/">Google+</a> users or
  <a href="https://support.google.com/groups/answer/46601?hl=en">Google
  Groups</a> to <a href=
  "{@docRoot}distribute/googleplay/developer-console.html#alpha-beta">beta-test</a>
  your app can help you kickstart your community while you listen to and
  respond to your user feedback.
</p>

<p>
  Once you’ve launched, your Google+ or other social media presence can help
  you continue to gather feedback, answer questions, and get input on updates.
  Use social media to get the conversation started. Post updates to your
  followers, announce new apps, and host contests. Ask followers to re-post so
  that they bring new users into the conversation. Fans love to profess their
  passion for great apps, so be sure to give them plenty of reason to do so.
</p>

<p>
  Forums like <a href=
  "https://support.google.com/groups/answer/46601?hl=en">Google Groups</a> are
  particularly well suited to help you and your users provide support to
  others. By helping out your community, you’re building your fan base who will
  share their experiences with other prospective customers.
</p>

<p>
  Respond to comments and reviews on both your product details page on Google
  Play and <a href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</a> pages. Prospective
  customers are influenced by reviews and comments, so be sure to manage your
  brand in every channel you can.

<p>
  Engaged users want you to succeed. Let them know you’re listening! Responding
  to posts, comments, and other social media mentions improves your ratings by
  letting users know you care.
</p>

<p>
  Update the product based on user feedback and announce new releases. Users
  often change their original star ratings after feeling heard, inspiring more
  users to install your apps.
</p>

<p>
  There are many ways to make your community feel special. Consider polls to
  let users influence product updates. Use competitions to inspire and reward
  your community. Giving a special <em>member of the week</em> badge is an easy
  way to recognize those that help others. Or get users involved in testing new
  versions or new apps to make them feel special.
