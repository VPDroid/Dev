<p>
  Successful developers have found that understanding what users do inside
  their app is the key to engaging and monetizing users in the long run.
  Various analytics tools are available that let you answer different types of
  questions. The easiest way to measure what users do in your app is to
  integrate a single analytics tool, such as Google Analytics, that's capable
  of answering all of your important questions.

<p style="margin-bottom:2em;">
  With a unique Google Play Developer Console integration, Google Analytics can
  track how users move through the <a href=
  "{@docRoot}distribute/analyze/improve-roi.html#flow">acquisition flow</a>
  from marketing, to a Play store listing, to launching an app. The <a href=
  "{@docRoot}distribute/analyze/build-better-apps.html#flows">Behavior flow</a>
  lets you easily identify roadblocks and successful features, so that you can
  improve user engagement. By implementing <a href=
  "{@docRoot}distribute/analyze/measure.html#retail">e-commerce tracking</a>
  you can have a full view of the transactions, such as in-app purchases,
  happening in your app. And, if you show ads in your app, you can <a href=
  "{@docRoot}distribute/analyze/google-services.html">access your Analytics
  data in AdMob</a> and have the full picture of your app revenue.
