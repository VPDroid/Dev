 * Include this gradle file if you are building against this as a standalone gradle library project,
 * but are defining the compile SDK version and build tools version at the top-level.
 *
 * For example, you can include the following in your settings.gradle file:
 *      include ':setup-wizard-lib'
 *      project(':setup-wizard-lib').projectDir = new File(PATH_TO_THIS_DIRECTORY)
 *      project(':setup-wizard-lib').buildFileName = 'standalone-rules.gradle'
 *
 * And then you can include the :setup-wizard-lib project as one of your dependencies
 *      dependencies {
 *          compile project(path: ':setup-wizard-lib', configuration: 'icsCompatRelease')
 *      }

    //      }

    // And then in rules.gradle you can reference the dependency by
    //      dependencies {
    //          compile deps['project-name']
    //      }
    //
