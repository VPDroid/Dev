/**
 * Build the file with local dependencies. This is typically the build file you want to use when
 * building from the Android source tree. The difference between this and standalone.gradle is that
 * this will build the dependencies like support libraries from source, whereas standalone.gradle
 * will get it from maven central.
 *
 * For example, you can include the following in your settings.gradle file:
 *      include ':setup-wizard-lib'
 *      project(':setup-wizard-lib').projectDir = new File(PATH_TO_THIS_DIRECTORY)
 *
 * And then you can include the :setup-wizard-lib project as one of your dependencies
 *      dependencies {
 *          compile project(path: ':setup-wizard-lib', configuration: 'icsCompatRelease')
 *      }
